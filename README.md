# CS3560A3

This assignment required me to update assignment 2 with extra features.
I added two more buttons to the Twitter Admin GUI. One of them displays whether all of the IDs are valid or not, and the other button displays the last user who had updated. Both of these statuses will display in a label located above the "Show User Total" button. These two buttons are located on the bottom of the right panel.

I also added two labels in the User View UI on the bottom that display the creation time and the update time of either following someone or posting a tweet. Both of the times are displayed in milliseconds.

I mostly changed the TwitterGUI.java, User.java, and LeftTreePanel.java files. If you want to see the differences, you can look at the "Assignment 3 Branch" branch in CS3560A2 repository and click on the "Compare" button on the top right of the files window.
